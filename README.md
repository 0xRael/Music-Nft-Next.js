Basically, a platform where musicians can mint NFTs with their music, put them to sell, and users can easily buy these NFTs, with all the Market logic happening on-chain

## My Music NFT Marketplace

You need a Wallet to use this! This supports WalletConnect!
Contracts were deployed to Sepolia, when minting, NFT metadata uploads to IPFS via Pinata API! So you can now view them in other Markets too!
